This app is part of Udacity's [Android Basics: Networking](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud843) 
course, which showcases how to create an options menu which takes the user to a Settings screen 
where he/she can edit a set of key-value pairs that will be preserved, even if the user closes the
app.
